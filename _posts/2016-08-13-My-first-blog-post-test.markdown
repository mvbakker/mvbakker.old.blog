This is my first post. I am still trying to set everything up properly. Especially having a hard time with the DNS settings. Yesterday I bought a domain at [transip.nl][transip]. There are nice guides for setting up the DNS settings provided by both Transip and Github Pages.

The goal is (and probably when you're able to read this it worked) to use my personal domain from Transip and use Github Pages as the hosting webserver. It should all start working shortly, however I've read that it can take up to a day before the DNS service is updated. So until then my domain is just send to a general starting page provided by Transip.

We'll see what happens.
