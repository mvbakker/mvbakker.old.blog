  Welcome to my blog! This is where I document my projects. As a beginner 
  I know it can be frustrating to get your projects to work. Via this blog 
  I hope I'll be able to help out my fellow struggling enthusiasts by 
  describing how I solved my challenges. Good luck to you all and remember, 
  if everything fails type: 'sudo!!'
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://mvbakker.nl" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
